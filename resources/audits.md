To date, the Pinto ecosystem and its predecessor Beanstalk have undergone 20 audits. These audits include both full-protocol and audits of specific features. Additionally, the Pinto ecosystem is secured by a 1,200,000 Pinto bug bounty program through Immunefi.

## Inherited Security

Pinto was forked from Beanstalk after BIP-50 was deployed. From this, Pinto inherits the audits and security efforts of Beanstalk on the vast majority of the protocol code. Detailed information about the audit history of Beanstalk can be found at the link below.

## Improvements Beyond Beanstalk

Pinto implemented minor changes on top of Beanstalk, as well as several incremental upgrades since launch, which are outlined in the [improvements.md](../appendix/improvements.md "mention") section. All of the protocol changes have been audited by Cantina and the report can be read [here](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/7f6b0aba-532d-4433-9fc7-873842beb974).

sPinto is an extension of Pinto built entirely external to the protocol contracts. sPinto was audited by both Egis Security and Cantina before launch. The audit reports can be referenced [here](https://github.com/Egis-Security/audits/blob/main/reports/SiloedPinto.pdf) and [here](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/c7410678-05f5-4dc3-bdbd-976d11738bcd).
