Pinto will be upgraded to issue assets to holders of Beanstalk debt based on a snapshot of the state of Beanstalk at the time of Pinto deployment. After a supply of 1B Pinto, [3% of mints will go to paying back old Beanstalk debt holders](../farm/sun.md#shipments) as follows:

* [Fertilizer](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/farm/barn#fertilizer) holders will receive ERC-1155 tokens similar to the existing Fertilizer tokens;
* [Unripe Bean](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/farm/barn#unripe-assets) holders will receive an asset representing a recapitalized Unripe asset (Ripening Pinto) at a rate of 1 Ripening Pinto per Unripe Bean;
* [Unripe LP](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/farm/barn#unripe-assets) holders will receive an amount of Ripening Pinto based on the Bean Denominated Value of Unripe LP if Beanstalk were fully recapitalized at the time of snapshot; and
* Pod holders will receive Pods in a separate Beanstalk Pod Line.

(1) Active Fertilizer holders, (2) Ripening Pinto holders and (3) Pod holders in this separate Beanstalk Pod Line each receive 1/3 of Pinto mints allocated to paying back old Beanstalk holders (_i.e._, 1% of mints).

If there is no Active Fertilizer, Ripening Pinto holders and Beanstalk Pod holders each receive 1/2 of Pinto mints allocated to paying back old Beanstalk holders (_i.e._, 1.5% of mints).

If there are neither Active Fertilizer nor Ripening Pinto, Beanstalk Pod holders receive 100% of the Pinto mints allocated to paying back old Beanstalk holders (_i.e._, 3% of mints).

If there is no longer any outstanding Active Fertilizer, Ripening Pinto nor Beanstalk Pods, the 3% of mints allocated to honoring Beanstalk debt will be distributed to Pinto participants under its normal model.

Pinto is not allocating any mints for Beans or liquid LP tokens held by Beanstalk the time of the snapshot.
