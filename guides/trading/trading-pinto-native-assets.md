# Trading Pinto-Native Assets

Pinto and Pinto-native assets can be bought and sold on the [Swap](https://pinto.money/swap) page. To transfer between Wallet and Circulating balances, see [Transferring Balances](../balances/transferring-balances.md).

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Navigate to the 'Swap' page.
3. In the first field select the input token, or the asset you would like to sell. The dropdown menu will show each available input token and your total Wallet Balance and Farm Balance.
   * [Wallet Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#wallet-balance) is the balance in your wallet, separate from Pinto.
   * [Farm Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#farm-assets) is the balance stored within the Pinto protocol.
4. In the second field, select the output token, or the asset you would like to buy.
5. Enter the amount of the input token to sell, up to the amount held in your Wallet and Farm balances.
6. Verify the amount of the output token you will receive in the 'Buy' field.
7. Under 'Destination', select 'Wallet Balance' or 'Farm Balance'.
8. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
9. If an approval is not necessary, skip to Step 11. For all other cases, select 'Approve Spending'. This allows the Pinto contract to spend the token, but does not execute the trade yet.
10. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
11. Select 'Swap'.
12. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
13. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your assets will depend on the option selected in Step 7:
    * If 'Wallet Balance' was selected, the assets will be in your wallet.
    * If 'Farm Balance' was selected, view your balances by selecting your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Farm Balance'.
