# Withdraw from the Silo

The associated amount of Stalk, Seeds, and Stalk from Seeds from a given Deposit must be forfeited when the Deposit is Withdrawn from the Silo. You can find more information about Withdrawals [here](../../farm/silo.md#withdraw).

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](https://docs.pinto.money/guides/getting-started/connect-to-pinto).
2. Navigate to the 'Silo' page. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](../../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist).
3. Select the asset you want to Withdraw. You must already have a Deposit of this asset in order to Withdraw.
4. Select the 'Withdraw' tab and enter the amount of the Deposited asset you would like to Withdraw. You may Withdraw any amount up to your 'Total' shown below the input box.
5. Under 'Destination', select '[Wallet Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#wallet-balance)' or '[Farm Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#farm-assets)'. Selecting Wallet Balance returns Withdrawn assets to your wallet. Selecting Farm Balance keeps the asset stored in Pinto.
6. A transaction preview showing the [decrease in Stalk and Seeds](../../farm/silo.md#the-stalk-system) will appear below the inputs.
7. Select 'Withdraw'.
8. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](https://docs.pinto.money/resources/contracts) before signing it.
9. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your assets will depend on the option selected in Step 5:
   * If 'Wallet Balance' was selected, the assets will be in your wallet.
   * If 'Farm Balance' was selected, view your balances by selecting your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Farm Balance'.
   * If your Withdraw was a liquidity pool token, you can unwrap it to the underlying assets by selecting the 'Unwrap via Pinto Exchange' button.
