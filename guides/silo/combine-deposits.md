# Combine Deposits

Combining Deposits will merge them into a single Deposit. While this can reduce gas fees for future Silo transactions, it comes with a tradeoff: your Stalk gets averaged across the combined Deposits. As a result, withdrawing from the Silo will burn more Stalk than if you had kept the Deposits separate.

Note: Combining is not available yet on the mobile UI.

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Navigate to the 'Silo' page. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](../../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist).
3. Select the asset you want to combine. You must already have multiple Deposits of this asset in order to combine.
4. Select 'Combine Deposits'.
5. Pick which Deposits you want to combine, or use 'Select All' to combine all Deposits of this asset.
6. Check that the number shown in the 'Combine Deposits' button matches the Deposits you want to combine, then select to proceed.
7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
8. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, your combined Deposit will appear in the 'My Deposits' table on the current page.
