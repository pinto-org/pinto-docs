# Deposit in the Silo

Assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](../../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist) can be Deposited in the [Silo](../../farm/silo.md) to earn [Stalk](../../resources/glossary.md#stalk) and [Seeds](../../resources/glossary.md#seeds).&#x20;

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Navigate to the 'Silo' page. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](../../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist).
3. Select the asset you want to Deposit.
4. Select the 'Deposit' tab.
5. There is a drop down menu to select the token you would like to Deposit.
   * Deposits may be made in any Pinto-native asset and will be converted as part of the transaction using [Pinto Exchange](https://pinto.exchange/).
6. Enter the amount you want to Deposit. A transaction preview showing the Stalk and Seeds to be rewarded will appear below the inputs.
7. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.5%.
   * The transaction will revert if it doesn't meet the specified conditions.
8. If an approval is not necessary, skip to Step 10. For all other cases, select 'Approve Spending'. This allows the Pinto contract to spend the asset, but does not Deposit it yet.
9. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
10. Select 'Deposit'.
11. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
