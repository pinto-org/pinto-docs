# Send Tokens

You can transfer Deposits, Pods, and tokens from your Farm Balance between Base addresses. When transferring Deposits, you'll keep all your Stalk and Seeds.

To transfer assets between [Wallet Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#wallet-balance) and [Farm Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#farm-assets), see [Transferring Balances](transferring-balances.md).

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Select your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Send'.
3. Select which tokens to send or 'Send Everything'.&#x20;
   * If you are not sending all the the tokens held by the connected address, select which Deposits, Pods, or Farm Balance tokens to send.
4. Enter the Base address where the tokens will be sent.
5. Under 'Confirm send', review the tokens to be sent and the receiving address for accuracy.
6. Select 'Send'.
7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
8. Connect the receiving wallet to Pinto after the transaction is confirmed to view your sent tokens.
