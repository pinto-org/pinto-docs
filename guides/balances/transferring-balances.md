# Transferring Balances

The Transfer Tokens field can be used to transfer tokens between your [Wallet Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#wallet-balance) and [Farm Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#farm-assets).

To send Pinto assets to another Base address, see [Send Tokens](send-tokens.md).

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Select your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Manage Farm Balance'.
3. Use the ⇅ button to switch between sending from Wallet Balance to Farm Balance, or from Farm Balance to Wallet Balance.
4. Select the token and enter the amount you want to send in the 'Amount and Token to Transfer' field.
5. If an approval is not necessary, skip to Step 7. For all other cases, select “Approve Spending”. This allows the Pinto contract to spend the token, but does transfer it yet.
6. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
7. Select “Transfer”.
8. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
9. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your assets will depend on the direction of the transfer.
   * If the destination was 'Wallet Balance', the assets will be in your wallet.
   * If the destination was 'Farm Balance', view your balances by selecting your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Farm Balance'.
