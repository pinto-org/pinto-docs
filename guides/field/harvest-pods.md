# Harvest Pods

Once [Pods](../../resources/glossary.md#pods) reach the front of the [Pod Line](../../resources/glossary.md#pod-line), they become [Harvestable](../../resources/glossary.md#harvestable-pods). Harvestable Pods are redeemable for 1 Pinto each.

1. Make sure you are on [https://pinto.money/](https://pinto.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-to-pinto.md).
2. Navigate to the 'Field' page.
3. Select the 'Harvest' tab, which shows how many Pods you can convert into Pinto through Harvesting.
4. Under 'Destination', select '[Wallet Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#wallet-balance)' or '[Farm Balance](../../resources/glossary.md#farm-assets)'. Selecting Wallet Balance sends the Pinto to your wallet. Selecting Farm Balance keeps the Pinto stored within the protocol.
5. Select 'Harvest'.
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
7. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of the Pinto from your Harvestable Pods will depend on the option selected in Step 4:
   * If 'Wallet Balance' was selected, the Pinto will be in your wallet.&#x20;
   * If 'Farm Balance' was selected, view your balances by selecting your wallet address in the upper right, then select 'Farm Balance'.
