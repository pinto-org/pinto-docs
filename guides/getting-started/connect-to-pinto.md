# Connect to Pinto

Interacting with Pinto requires a wallet on the [Base network](https://www.base.org/) with an Ethereum (ETH) balance. If you don't have a wallet yet, learn how to [Fund a Wallet on Base](fund-a-wallet-on-base.md).

Pinto works with many Base-compatible wallets. Here's how to connect using Rabby as an example, though the process is similar for other wallets.
