# Where to Begin?

**New to Pinto?** Learn the basics by reading about the [primary components of Pinto](../../farm/overview.md).

**Ready to use Pinto?** Participate in Pinto and earn yield through different components of the [Farm](../../farm/overview.md):

* **Silo:** Earn yield by [Depositing](../../resources/glossary.md#deposit) whitelisted assets. Silo Deposits earn a portion of new Pinto mints. Learn more [about the Silo](../../farm/silo.md) and how to [Deposit in the Silo](../silo/deposit-in-the-silo.md).
* **Field:** Earn yield by [Sowing](../../resources/glossary.md#sow) (lending) Pinto to Pinto. Lenders receive [Pods](../../resources/glossary.md#pods), which are placed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) line that earns a portion of new Pinto mints. Pods become [Harvestable](../../resources/glossary.md#harvestable-pods) (redeemable) at an indeterminate future time for a fixed number of Pinto. Learn more [about the Field ](../../farm/field.md)and how to [Sow Pinto](../field/sow-pinto.md).
* **Market**: Buy and sell Pinto-native assets and transfer your balances between your wallet and the Pinto protocol. Learn more about [Trading Pinto](../trading/trading-pinto-native-assets.md) and [Transferring Balances](../balances/transferring-balances.md).
