# Wrap/Unwrap sPinto

Siloed Pinto (sPINTO) is a fungible Pinto Deposit wrapper that captures Silo yield. It leverages the ERC-20 and [ERC-4626](https://erc4626.info/) standards to achieve composability in the DeFi ecosystem and provide utility for Pinto outside of the core protocol. For more information on how sPinto works check out [spinto.md](../appendix/spinto.md "mention").

### Wrap

To get sPinto and start earning yield follow the steps below:

* Go to [https://pinto.money/wrap](https://pinto.money/wrap)
* On the left, choose how you wish to use to wrap sPinto. By pressing the toggle, you can wrap from silo deposits or any ERC20.&#x20;
* If you choose to unwrap to an ERC20, In the backend the interface will unwrap your token to Pinto and swap it for the token you choose.
* You can also wrap your existing Pinto silo deposits into sPinto. Note that Stalk is socialized among sPinto holders and not returned in equal proportion when unwrapping. Therefore, users wrapping sPinto directly from Silo Deposits should be wary of the Stalk cost of using older Deposits. If you wish to wrap your existing deposits, the UI will pick the deposits with the least amount of grown stalk to use.
* Here we will use USDC to buy Pinto and wrap it directly.
