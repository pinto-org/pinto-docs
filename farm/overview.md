# Overview

The Farm contains the Pinto ecosystem. Anyone can become a Farmer by interacting with Pinto.

The Farm has four primary components: the Sun, Silo, Field and Toolshed.

The [Sun](sun.md) offers payment to Farmers for participating in timekeeping and ensuring regular code execution. Time on the Farm is kept in Seasons.

The [Silo](silo.md) offers passive yield opportunities to Farmers for Depositing Pinto and other whitelisted assets. The Silo uses the Stalk System to minimize the frequency and veracity of bank runs.

The [Field](field.md) offers yield opportunities to Farmers for lending Pinto to the protocol. The Field uses a FIFO payment schedule and Dutch auction to create the optimal conditions for the protocol to borrow.

The [Toolshed](toolshed/) offers a suite of tools to Farmers for efficient use of Pinto and other protocols on Base. Nothing in the Toolshed is directly related to target maintenance.&#x20;
