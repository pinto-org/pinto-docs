# Farm Balances

Farm Balances are assets stored on the Farm that are not otherwise Deposited in the Silo, locked in Pod Orders, etc. With Farm Balances, the protocol is able to store any ERC-20 token on behalf of a Farmer.&#x20;

All interactions with the protocol that use a Farmer's ERC-20 tokens can use tokens from either Farm or Wallet Balances. All interactions with the protocol that send ERC-20 tokens can send tokens to a Farmer's Farm or Wallet Balances.

Farm Balances can reduce transactions costs for using tokens that remain in the protocol.
