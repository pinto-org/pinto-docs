# Farm Balances

Farm Balances are assets stored on the Farm that are not Deposited in the Silo or locked in Pod\
Orders. Farm Balances enable the protocol to store any ERC-20 token on behalf of a user.

All interactions with the protocol that use a userâ€™s ERC-20 tokens can use tokens from both Farm\
and Wallet Balances.
